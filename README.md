All you need to do is take a selfie. ISP will do the rest of the magic* and provide you with a song that fits your musical taste, feeling and environment.

Don't worry, the picture stays on your device.

## Background

I developed this project during the course [Interaction/Programming](https://glossar.hs-augsburg.de/Lehrveranstaltung:IAM_2006:Interaktion/Programmierung) by [Prof. Dr. Thomas Rist](https://www.hs-augsburg.de/Informatik/Thomas-Rist.html) at the [University of Applied Sciences Augsburg](https://www.hs-augsburg.de/). In addition to the web application I wrote a [paper](./docs/intelligent_song_picker_florian_kapaun.pdf) about this project.

## ToDo

- Improve stability
- Add Autoplay function to go on playing songs after the first one is finished
- Handle Spotify non-premium users
- Add contenthash to js files for improved caching
- Create robust mobile version (currently a very bad workaround is in place here)
- Reduce own queries to spotify and instead leverage the capabilities of the Spotify Web Playback SDK
